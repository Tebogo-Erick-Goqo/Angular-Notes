AngularJS is an older version of the Angular framework, 
and ng-model is a directive in AngularJS used to bind input controls like input, select, 
and textarea to a variable or property defined in the scope of a controller.

The ng-model directive is used to create a two-way data binding between the view and the model. 
When the value of the input control changes, the model is updated, and when the value of the model changes, the input control is updated.

Here's an example of how to use ng-model in AngularJS:

python
Copy code
<input type="text" ng-model="name">
In this example, the ng-model directive is used to bind the value of the input element to the name variable in the controller's scope. 
Whenever the user types something into the input field, the name variable is updated automatically.

It's important to note that in newer versions of Angular (i.e., Angular 2 and above), 
ng-model has been replaced with a more robust and flexible system of reactive forms and form controls.
