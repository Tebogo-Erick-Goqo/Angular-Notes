Angular is an open-source web application framework developed by Google. 
It is used to build dynamic and responsive web applications, which can be run on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. 
Angular is based on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and provides a range of features and tools to help developers create high-quality applications.

Some of the key features of Angular include:

Component-based architecture: Angular applications are built using components, 
which are reusable building blocks that contain both the UI and the business logic of an application.

Two-way data binding: Angular provides two-way data binding, which allows changes in the model to be reflected in the view and vice versa.

Dependency injection: Angular's dependency injection system makes it easy to manage dependencies between components and services.

RxJS: Angular includes RxJS, a library for reactive programming that allows developers to manage complex asynchronous operations.

Angular CLI: Angular comes with a command-line interface (CLI) tool that makes it easy to create, build, and test Angular applications.

Overall, Angular is a powerful and flexible framework that is well-suited for building large-scale, complex web applications.
